Explanation: Visibility Timeout & DLQ Usage

### Visibility Timeout

The visibility timeout in Amazon SQS ensures that when a message is retrieved by a consumer (like a Lambda function), it becomes temporarily invisible to other consumers. This prevents the same message from being processed multiple times concurrently.

In this project:
- When the Lambda function starts processing a message from `OrderQueue`, the message becomes invisible.
- If processing succeeds, the message is deleted.
- If the Lambda crashes or throws an error, the message becomes visible again after the timeout expires, allowing for retry.

This guarantees **at-least-once delivery** and protects against race conditions or duplicate writes to DynamoDB.

### âœ… Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ)

The Dead-Letter Queue (DLQ) is a secondary queue where failed messages are sent after a specified number of failed processing attempts (e.g., 3 tries).

In this system:
- `OrderDLQ` is linked to `OrderQueue` with `maxReceiveCount = 3`.
- If a message causes an error (e.g., bad JSON, missing fields) and fails 3 times, it is automatically moved to `OrderDLQ`.
- This avoids repeated processing of broken data and keeps the main queue clean.

You can inspect `OrderDLQ` later to fix or reprocess failed messages.

###  Summary

By combining **Visibility Timeout** and **DLQ**, the system becomes more resilient:
-  Avoids infinite loops on bad messages
-  Allows safe retry logic without duplicates
-  Helps with debugging and future improvements

This design is essential for reliable, production-grade serverless applications.
